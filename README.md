# assignment-one

Haskell project for assignment-one
Tic Tac Toe game with rotation mechanic and CPU to play against.

* Doctests

* Four different flags to start with: hm (human vs machine), mm (machine vs machine), hh (human vs human) and help.

Example: stack run hm

Ex: stack run help

stack run inside root to run the program

stack test inside root to run the doctests

## `Main`
* Functions for command line arguments

## `Iofuncs` module
* Contains all "dirty" IO code

## `Lib` module
* Contains the pure functions

## Time logging
Thinking about various problems and designs: 7-12 hours\n
searching for things: 4-7 hours\n
Own coding/documenting: ~25 hours\n

## Collaboration and sources
Discussed some of the problems with Sander Fuhr
