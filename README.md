* Doctests

* Four different flags to start with: hm (human vs machine), mm (machine vs machine), hh (human vs human) and help.

Example: stack run hm

Ex: stack run help

stack run inside root to run the program

## `Main`
* Functions for command line arguments

## `Iofuncs` module
* Contains all "dirty" IO code

## `Lib` module

## Time logging
Thinking about various problems and designs: 7-12 hours
searching for things: 4-6 hours
Own coding/documenting: 25 hours

## Collaboration and sources
Discussed some of the problems with Sander Fuhr

Also took inspiration from
